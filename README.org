** Features
   - Quickly grab regions of code, functions, or whole buffers with a link back to the source to insert into org-documents or org-capture blocks
   - include a link to the region or function in your git forge with [[https://github.com/sshaw/git-link][git-link.el]] (requires installation of git-link)

** Installation
   Not yet on MELPA - clone it into your elisp load path for now!

   Example Configuration with [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]]:

   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (use-package show-your-work
       :commands show-your-work-kill-snippet
       :defer t
       :bind (:map ctrl-x-map ("y" . show-your-work-kill-snippet))
       :after (org-capture which-func))
   #+end_src

* Usage
  Call =show-your-work-kill-snippet= with your point inside a function or with a
  region selected. Using this repo as an example, calling the function with
  point on line 36 in =./show-your-work.el= will push the following =org= markup
  onto the kill ring:
  #+begin_src org

  [[https://github.com/0x6362/show-your-work.el/blob/main/show-your-work.el#L35-L37][show-your-work.el:35]] // ~show-your-work--git-link-available-p~
#+begin_src elisp
(defun show-your-work--git-link-available-p ()
  "Check if git-link is available for use."
  (fboundp 'git-link))
#+end_src
  #+end_src

  Similarly, with a region:
  #+begin_src org
  [[https://github.com/0x6362/show-your-work.el/blob/main/show-your-work.el#L35-L45][show-your-work.el:35]] // ~show-your-work--git-link-copy-url-only~
  #+begin_src elisp
    (defun show-your-work--git-link-available-p ()
      "Check if git-link is available for use."
      (fboundp 'git-link))

    (defun show-your-work--git-link-copy-url-only ()
      "Get a permalink via git-link if available."
      (if (show-your-work--git-link-available-p)
          (let (git-link-open-in-browser)
            (call-interactively 'git-link)
            (pop kill-ring))
        (error "Install git-link.el to use this functionality")))
  #+end_src
  #+end_src

  Because I have =git-link= available in my emacs, a link to the file on the
  currently active git branch on the remote git forge is included in the
  snippet.
